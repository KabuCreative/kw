    <h2>Expert interstate removalists</h2>

    <p>King &amp; Wilson have over 100 years experience of moving Australians interstate.</p>
    <p>We have the people and processes to ensure your move is both smooth and cost effective. How it works:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>We conduct an in-home consultation to guide you through the moving process and determine the best moving schedule for you. This process usually takes between 30 minutes and one hour.</li>
        <li>On the scheduled day, we visit your home to pack your cartons and professionally wrap your furniture.</li>
        <li>Your goods are transferred into and sealed within a hi-cube furniture container (using a container minimises handling and allows for short term storage at either end of your move).</li>
        <li>The container is transported by road and/or train to your new home.</li>
        <li>We ensure all of your necessary paperwork is in order to facilitate prompt clearance of interstate quarantine.</li>
        <li>We unpack your cartons, position your furniture and dispose of any mess.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>

    <p><strong>Can I pack my own boxes?</strong></p>
    <p>Yes, you can pack your own boxes. Some clients elect to pack clothes, books and linen and leave the more fragile items to us. If you choose to do this, we will supply you with appropriate professional quality boxes and packing materials.</p>
    <p>We can also provide you with instructions for packing your boxes to professional standards, however we can not be responsible for any breakages in boxes packed by you.</p>

    <p><strong>How will my possessions be moved?</strong></p>
    <p>Most interstate removals are effected using specially constructed hi-cube furniture containers which are loaded and sealed at residence. These containers travel between Australian cities on the Pacific National freight rail network. The use of inter-modal containers is a feature of the contemporary Australian moving industry, offering customers the benefits of minimising excessive handling and allowing for short term storage at interstate destinations. </p>

    <p><strong>How much notice do I need to provide?</strong></p>
    <p>The amount of notice required depends on the nature of your move. We recommend that you book your interstate move four to six weeks prior to departure. Booking ahead will allow us to secure and confirm your booking for your preferred dates and give you sufficient time to prepare for your move. </p>
    <p>Of course, interstate moves can be still be arranged successfully at shorter notice, depending on your individual circumstances.</p>

    <p><strong>How long will it take for my things to arrive?</strong></p>
    <p>Transit times vary depending on the distance involved and the quantity of goods being moved. Transit times for full containers are:
    <ul>
        <li>Sydney to Melbourne - 2 days</li>
        <li>Sydney to Brisbane - 2 days</li>
        <li>Melbourne to Brisbane - 3 days</li>
        <li>Melbourne/Sydney to Perth - 5 days</li>
        <li>Melbourne/Sydney to Darwin - 5 days</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Please <a href="/contact-us/">contact us</a> for transit times to destinations not listed above.</p>

    <p><strong>Can you move art, antiques, pianos or billiard tables?</strong></p>
    <p>Yes, we can!  We have a specialist staff who are trained and accustomed to moving antiques. We also have an <a href="/art/">art transport division</a> equipped and skilled at moving, storing and installing valuable and fragile works of art. This department uses specialised air ride climate vehicles and our art handlers are trained to museum handling standards.
    <p>Many of our vehicles contain piano trolleys and have hydraulic tail lifters. Our staff are also experienced at disassembling and reassembling grand pianos and multi piece slate billiard tables.</p>

    <p><strong>Do I need insurance?</strong></p>
    <p>Whilst it is unusual for items to be damaged or lost in transit, for your peace of mind we recommend that you take out <a href="/insurance/">transit insurance</a>. To help you get the right cover, we have put together a cost-effective policy specifically designed to protect your goods during transit and/or storage in our warehouses.</p>
