        <h2>Packing boxes and materials</h2>
        <p>All international baggage quotations from within metropolitan areas include supply and delivery of high quality packing boxes, packing paper and tape for clients to pack their belongings. Should you wish for our staff to pack your consignment for you, an additional charge of $20 per carton (minimum $60) will be applicable.</p>
        <p>Please note that airline security restrictions prohibit unknown shippers from packing their own boxes, this means that all boxes and packages sent by air with King &amp; Wilson will be checked at our warehouse by our security accredited staff to ensure prohibited, flammable or dangerous items are not included. There is no additional charge for air security checking.</p>
        <p>When you make a booking, one of our consultants will liaise with you regarding the size and quantity of boxes you think you may require. We will always include a few more cartons than you think you will need, just in case. Don't worry - anything you don't use will be collected when we collect your consignment.</p></p>
