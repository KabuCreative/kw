    <h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>

    <p><strong>I only want to ship a few items. Can you still help me?</strong></p>
    <p>Yes we can. Our <a href="/excess-baggage/">excess baggage</a> department specialises in packing and shipping small quantities of unaccompanied personal effects.</p>
    <p>To get an instant baggage quote, please click <a href="#">here</a>.</p>

    <p><strong>Can I pack my boxes myself?</strong></p>
    <p>Yes, you can pack your own boxes. Some clients elect to pack clothes, books and linen and leave the more fragile items to us. If you choose to do this, we will supply you with appropriate export quality boxes and packing materials.</p>
    <p>We can also provide you with instructions for packing your boxes to export standards, however we can not be responsible for any breakages in boxes packed by you.</p>

    <p><strong>How long will it take for my belongings to arrive?</strong></p>
    <p>Shipping from Australia to the US takes 9 - 12 weeks depending on the location and the time of the year.  Shipping to Canada takes a little longer, with an estimated transit time of between 12 and 16 weeks.</p>
    <p>In the unlikely event your shipment is delayed beyond this timeframe, we will refund your freight charges in full.</p>
    <p>If you require some of your items to arrive within a shorter timeframe, we recommend utilising our <a href="/international-air-freight/">air freight</a> service. Many of our clients find this to be a more cost-effective solution than paying airline excess baggage.</p>

    <p><strong>Do you deliver to a house or apartment?</strong></p>
    <p>Our standard international moving service includes delivery to a residence up to first floor with clear vehicle access from the street. This service is inclusive of checking off the packing list, placing furniture and boxes into nominated rooms, unwrapping and re-assembling furniture items, unpacking boxes onto flat surfaces and removing the packing debris and rubbish.</p>
    <p>Our international baggage services are priced to be a more economical transport solution and therefore delivery is to ground floor only and excludes unpacking.</p>

    <p><strong>Can I track my shipment?</strong></p>
    <p>Yes, we provide our customers with regular email updates and a client login to our website which allows you to monitor the progress of your shipment.</p>

    <p><strong>Is there anything that I can't ship?</strong></p>
    <p>For safety and security there are some items that cannot be shipped. Most of these items fall under the classification of prohibited belongings such as LPG gas bottles, paints, aerosols and solvents.</p>
    <p><a href="#">Download a full list of prohibited items here</a>.</p>

    <p><strong>Do I need insurance?</strong></p>
    <p>Whilst it is unusual for items to be damaged or lost in transit, for your peace of mind we recommend that you take out <a href="/insurance/">transit insurance</a>. To help you get the right cover, we have put together a cost-effective policy specifically designed to protect your belongings during transit and/or storage in our warehouses.</p>
    <p><a href="#">Request a quote</a> or <a href="/contact-us/">contact us</a> to speak to a moving consultant about the appropriate insurance for your move.</p>

    <p><strong>Will I have to pay at United States or Canadian customs?</strong></p>
    <p>The importation of used personal effects into the USA is duty and tax free provided the person importing their belongings has been living outside of the USA longer than 12 months and the goods have been owned and used for longer than 12 months. For Canada, the required time is six months.</p>
    <p>The exemptions are alcohol and tobacco which are both taxable.</p>
    <p>For more information on US and Canadian customs regulations, please download our <a href="#">guide</a>.</p>
