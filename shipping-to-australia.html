    <strong class="q">I only want to ship a few items. Can you still help me?</strong>
    <div>
        <p>Yes we can. Our <a href="/excess-baggage/">excess baggage</a> department has relationships with many overseas baggage operators and can arrange door-to-door transport of your excess baggage shipment by air or sea back to Australia.</p>

    </div>

    <strong class="q">Can I pack my boxes myself?</strong>
    <div>
        <p>Yes, you can pack your own boxes. Some clients elect to pack clothes, books and linen and leave the more fragile items to us.</p>
        <p>We can provide you with instructions for packing your boxes to export standards, however we can not be responsible for any breakages in boxes packed by you.</p>
    </div>

    <strong class="q">How long will it take for my belongings to arrive?</strong>
    <div>
        <p>This depends on where you are shipping your belongings from, with most international shipping taking between 6 and 12 weeks.</p>
        <p>If you require some of your items to arrive within a shorter timeframe, we recommend utilising our <a href="/international-air-freight/">air freight</a> service. Many of our clients find this to be a more cost-effective solution than paying airline excess baggage.</p>
    </div>

    <strong class="q">Is there anything that I can't ship?</strong>
    <div>
        <p>For safety and security there are some items that cannot be shipped. Most of these items fall under the classification of prohibited belongings such as LPG gas bottles, paints, aerosols and solvents.</p>
        <p><a href="#">Download a full list of prohibited items here</a>.</p>
    </div>

    <strong class="q">Do I need insurance?</strong>
    <div>
        <p>Whilst it is unusual for items to be damaged or lost in transit, for your peace of mind we recommend that you take out <a href="/insurance/">transit insurance</a>. To help you get the right cover, we have put together a cost-effective policy specifically designed to protect your belongings during transit and/or storage.</p>
        <p><a href="#">Request a quote</a> or <a href="/contact-us/">contact us</a> to speak to a moving consultant about the appropriate insurance for your move.</p>
    </div>

    <strong class="q">Will I have to pay at Australian customs?</strong>
    <div>
        <p>The importation of used personal effects into Australia is duty and GST free provided the person importing their belongings has been living outside Australia longer than 12 months and the goods have been owned and used for longer than 12 months.</p>
        <p>The exemptions are alcohol and tobacco which are both dutiable and will also have GST applied.</p>
        <p>For more information on Australia's customs regulations, please download our <a href="#">guide</a>.</p>
