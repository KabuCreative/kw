        <h2>Packing / preparing for your move</h2>

        <div class="faqs">
            <strong class="q">Can I pack my own boxes?</strong>
            <div>
                <p>Yes, you can pack your own boxes. Some clients elect to pack clothes, books and linen and leave the more fragile items to us. If you choose to do this, we will supply you with appropriate export quality boxes and packing materials.</p>
                <p>We can also provide you with instructions for packing your boxes to export standards, however we can not be responsible for any breakages in boxes packed by you.</p>
                <p>Cartons and belongings which are to be transported overseas by air must be checked, repacked and sealed by King &amp; Wilson security cleared staff.</p>
            </div>

            <strong class="q">How should I prepare appliances before moving day?</strong>
            <div>
                <p>Your fridge should be emptied and wiped clean throughout. If it is going into storage, wiping the interior with vanilla essence will help keep any mildew at bay. We will store the fridge in accordance with manufacturers recommendations, with the door chocked ajar.</p>
                <p>It is imperative that washing machines be prepared properly as these are easily damaged. Most front loading washing machines require the insertion of stability bolts. It is not our responsibility to do this and any damage resulting in adequate security will not be our responsibility.</p>
            </div>

            <strong class="q">How long will the inspection / quotation process take?</strong>
            <div>
                <p>Our inspections process usually takes between 30 minutes and one hour and we strive to provide you with a quote within the following 24 hours.</p>

            <strong class="q">Can you move art, antiques, pianos or billiard tables?</strong>
            <div>
                <p>Yes, we can!  We have specialist staff who are trained and accustomed to moving antiques. We also have an <a href="/art/">art transport division</a> equipped and skilled at moving, storing and installing valuable and fragile works of art. This department uses specialised air ride climate vehicles and our art handlers are trained to museum handling standards.
                <p>Many of our vehicles contain piano trolleys and have hydraulic tail lifters. Our staff are also experienced at disassembling and reassembling grand pianos and multi piece slate billiard tables.</p>
            </div>

            <strong class="q">Is there anything I can't send?</strong>
            <div>
                <p>Yes, there are a number of belongings that are prohibited, including LPG gas bottles, paints, aerosols and solvents.</p>
                <p>A full list of prohibited items will be provided to you by your moving consultant.</p>
            </div>

            <strong class="q">How long will the removal take?</strong>
            <div>
                <p>This depends on the number of items we are moving and the ease of access. Your Moving Coordinator will be able to advise you of the approximate time we expect your move to take. Most homes require at least a day of pre-packing prior to the removal process.</p>
            </div>

            <strong class="q">Do I need to be there on moving day?</strong>
            <div>
                <p>No, you do not need to be present for the entire packing and moving process. However, if you are unable to attend in person, it is important that you nominate an authorised representative to allow our crews access to your home and be present to observe and sign your packing inventory.</p>
            </div>

            <strong class="q">Am I expected to give the removalists food or drink on when they are working?</strong>
            <div>
                <p>You are not expected to do this. However, providing tea, coffee and water for our staff is much appreciated.</p>
            </div>

            <strong class="q">Can I track my international shipment?</strong>
            <div>

        <h2>Storage</h2>

        <div class="faqs">
            <strong class="q">Do you have the facilities for storing large/unique items?</strong>
            <div>
                <p>Yes. We used a containerised system, so if you can fit it into a shipping container - you can store it with us.</p>
                <p>We also have specialist climate controlled storage facilities for works of art. <a href="/contact-us/">Contact us</a> for more information.</p>

                <p>Flammable or toxic items such as fuel, gases, paints, poisons, aerosol sprays are not permitted, nor are perishable items such as food and plants.</p>
            </div>

            <strong class="q">How often can I access my stored belongings?</strong>
            <div>
                <p>You can access your belongings during standard business hours, under supervision. If you need to access some possessions more often than others, we can arrange to pack the storage container to reflect this.</p>
            </div>

            <strong class="q">I only want to store a few items. Can you still help me?</strong>

        <div class="faqs">
            <strong class="q">Will I have to pay customs?</strong>
            <div>
                <p>This depends on what you are shipping and your final destination. Speak to your moving consultant for more information.</p>

        <h2>Administration</h2>
        <div class="faqs">
            <strong class="q">How much notice do I need to provide?</strong>
            <div>
                <p>The amount of notice required depends on the nature of your move. We recommend that you book your international removal three to four weeks prior to departure. You should allow one to two weeks notice for an Interstate removal. These suggested lead times will allow us to secure and confirm your booking for your preferred dates and give you sufficient time to prepare for your move. Our Moving Planners contain a useful time-line schedule of helpful tips to guide you through the process and have you ready for moving day.</p>
                <p>Please note that a greater leader time is required for moves planned for the peak Summer period which runs from December to January.</p>
            </div>

            <strong class="q">Do I need insurance?</strong>
            <div>
                <p>Whilst it is unusual for items to be damaged or lost in transit, for your peace of mind we recommend that you take out <a href="/insurance/">transit insurance</a>. To help you get the right cover, we have put together a cost-effective policy specifically designed to protect your belongings during transit and/or storage.</p>
                <p><a href="#" class="get-quote">Request a quote</a> or <a href="/contact-us/">contact us</a> to speak to a moving consultant about the appropriate insurance for your move.</p>

            <div>
                <p>All moves require full payment at least two working days prior to work commencing. King &amp; Wilson accepts all major credit cards and also provides for payment by BPAY.</p>
                <p>Our system also includes an on-line payment gateway which means our clients can pay for their moves via ANZ's e-gate secure payment system.</p>
