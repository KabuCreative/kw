    <h2>Packing / preparing for your move</h2>

    <p><strong>Can I pack my own boxes?</strong></p>
    <p>Yes, you can pack your own boxes. Some clients elect to pack clothes, books and linen and leave the more fragile items to us. If you choose to do this, we will supply you with appropriate export quality boxes and packing materials.</p>
    <p>We can also provide you with instructions for packing your boxes to export standards, however we can not be responsible for any breakages in boxes packed by you.</p>
    <p>Cartons and belongings which are to be transported overseas by air must be checked, repacked and sealed by King &amp; Wilson security cleared staff.</p>

    <p><strong>How should I prepare appliances before moving day?</strong></p>
    <p>Your fridge should be emptied and wiped clean throughout. If it is going into storage, wiping the interior with vanilla essence will help keep any mildew at bay. We will store the fridge in accordance with manufacturers recommendations, with the door chocked ajar.</p>
    <p>It is imperative that washing machines be prepared properly as these are easily damaged. Most front loading washing machines require the insertion of stability bolts. It is not our responsibility to do this and any damage resulting in adequate security will not be our responsibility.</p>

    <p><strong>How long will the removal take?</strong></p>
    <p>This depends on the number of items we are moving and the ease of access. Your Moving Coordinator will be able to advise you of the approximate time we expect your move to take. Most homes require at least a day of pre-packing prior to the removal process.</p>

    <p><strong>Do I need to be there on moving day?</strong></p>
    <p>No, you do not need to be present for the entire packing and moving process. However, if you are unable to attend in person, it is important that you nominate an authorised representative to allow our crews access to your home and be present to observe and sign your packing inventory.</p>
