    <h3>Frequently Asked Questions:</h3>

    <p><strong>Can I pack my boxes myself?</strong></p>
    <p>No, you cannot.  Airline (and airport) security specifies that all boxes must be packed by our accredited (and security certified) packers.</p>

    <p><strong>Is there anything I can't send?</strong></p>
    <p>Yes, there are a number of goods that are prohibited by airlines and airports, including LPG gas bottles, paints, aerosols and solvents.</p>
    <p>A full list of prohibited items will be provided to you by your moving consultant.</p>

    <p><strong>How much will it cost?</strong></p>
    <p>This depends on the amount you are shipping and the final destination.</p>
    <p>Whilst more expensive than sea freight, shipping by air is approximately TODO times more cost-effective than paying airline excess baggage fees.</p>
    <p><a href="#">Request a quote</a> or <a href="/contact-us/">contact us</a> for an accurate estimate.</p>

    <p><strong>How is the cost calculated?</strong></p>
    <p>Air freight is calculated by 'Chargeable Weight' - the Actual Gross Weight or the Volumetric Weight of the shipment â€“ whichever is the greater.</p>
    <p>To make matters more complicated, the formula for chargeable weight changes depending on the airline or air courier we partner with to ship your goods.</p>
    <p>In all cases, we move your goods in the most cost-effective manner - so to pass on the best possible price to you.  <a href="/contact-us/">Contact us</a> to receive an accurate, no obligation quote.</p>

    <p><strong>Do I need insurance?</strong></p>
    <p>Whilst it is unusual for items to be damaged or lost in transit, for your peace of mind we recommend that you take out <a href="/insurance/">transit insurance</a>.  To help you get the right cover, we have put together a cost-effective policy specifically designed to protect your goods during transit and/or storage in our warehouses.</p>
