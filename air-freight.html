    <strong class="q">Can I pack my boxes myself?</strong>
    <div>
        <p>You can pack your own boxes, however airline (and airport) security specifies that all boxes must be packed by our accredited (and security certified) packers.</p>
        <p>This means our staff are required to open any customer packed boxes and check the contents before re-sealing them with security tape.</p>
    </div>

    <strong class="q">Is there anything I can't send?</strong>
    <div>
        <p>Yes, there are a number of belongings that are prohibited by airlines and airports, including LPG gas bottles, paints, aerosols and solvents.</p>
        <p>A full list of prohibited items will be provided to you by your moving consultant.</p>
    </div>

    <strong class="q">How much will it cost?</strong>
    <div>
        <p>This depends on the amount you are shipping and the final destination.</p>
        <p>In some cases our air-freight service is more cost-effective than shipping by sea; this is particularly common when your destination is some distance from a major international sea port.</p>
        <p>It is also not uncommon for smaller smaller shipments of personal effects (up to three boxes) to be cheaper to move by air.</p>
        <p><a href="#">Request a Quote</a> or <a href="/contact-us/">contact us</a> for an accurate estimate.</p>
    </div>

    <strong class="q">How is the cost calculated?</strong>
    <div>
        <p>Air freight is calculated by 'chargeable weight' - the actual gross weight or the volumetric weight of the shipment â€“ whichever is the greater.</p>
        <p>To make matters more complicated, the formula for chargeable weight changes depending on the airline or air courier we partner with to ship your belongings.</p>
        <p>In all cases, we move your belongings in the most cost-effective manner so to pass on the best possible price to you. <a href="/contact-us/">Contact us</a> to receive an accurate, no obligation quote.</p>
    </div>

    <strong class="q">Do I need insurance?</strong>
    <div>
        <p>Whilst it is unusual for items to be damaged or lost in transit, for your peace of mind we recommend that you take out <a href="/insurance/">transit insurance</a>. To help you get the right cover, we have put together a cost-effective policy specifically designed to protect your belongings during transit and/or storage.</p>
