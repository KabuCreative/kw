    <strong class="q">I am only moving a few items, do I need insurance?</strong>
    <div>
        <p>Even if you are only moving a few boxes you should still consider taking out insurance. </p>
    </div>

    <strong class="q">Can I be insured if I pack my own boxes?</strong>
    <div>
        <p>Because your belongings have not been packed by a removalist, our policy excludes the contents of these cartons in the event of any damages/breakages.</p>
        <p>Owner packed cartons can only be insured for Restricted Cover, which provides cover for the following risks only:</p>

        <ul class="">
            <li>Fire and explosion</li>
            <li>Lightning, flood</li>
            <li>Overturning and/or derailment of conveyance</li>
            <li>Collision of vessel, aircraft or conveyance</li>
            <li>Crashing or forced landing of aircraft; stranding, sinking, or contact of vessel with any external object other than water</li>
            <li>Entry of water into any vessel, hold, container liftvan or place of storage</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Non-delivery of owner packed cartons is limited to $500.00 unless an itemised valued list of contents is supplied prior to the commencement of the transit.</p>
    </div>

    <strong class="q">Should I take insurance while my possessions are in storage?</strong>
    <div>
        <p>Yes. We can arrange an extension of your transit insurance to cover your belongings whilst they are in storage with us. The storage extension cover is available anywhere in Australia or for storage at any of our nominated agents worldwide. </p>
    </div>

    <strong class="q">I'm not sure I should bother. Shouldn't my home and contents insurance cover it?  Or your insurance?</strong>
    <div>
        <p>Ultimately, it is your decision.</p>
        <p>There are many circumstances for which we, as your remover, may not be liable to make good any loss or damage to your belongings - this is why we strongly recommend you take out transit insurance.</p>
        <p>If you think you don't need insurance, you should ask yourself why you would insure your belongings in your house (where there is low risk), and not when they are moving into a high risk situation.</p>
        <p>You should certainly check with your home and contents insurer to find out if your existing policy covers the transportation of your possessions.</p>

                <h2>Transit insurance for your peace of mind</h2>
                <p>Whilst most of our clients hold contents insurance, many are unaware that these policies often fail to cover the transit of belongings from one home to another.</p>
                <p>Whilst it is unusual for items to be lost or damanged in transit, for your peace of mind we recommend you take out moving insurance for the period your prossessions are being moved and stored.</p>
                <p>To help you get the right cover, we have put together a cost-effective policy specifically designed to protect your belongings during transit and/or storage.</p>
