    <strong class="q">How will my pet be transported?</strong>
    <div>
        <p>All pets are transported in custom travel crates within the pet cabin of commercial airlines. The pet cabin is dimly lit and set to a temperature of approximately 18deg celsius to ensure your pet is comfortable.</p>
        <p>To minimise flight time, we always book your pet on the most direct flight to your destination.</p>
        <p>Our pet moving service also includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Comprehensive itinerary</li>
            <li>Detailed information about your destinations quarantine and customs requirements</li>
            <li>Boarding (if required)</li>
            <li>Arranging an airline approved travel crate</li>
            <li>Collection in a specialist animal transport vehicle</li>
            <li>A home visit by a qualified veterinarian to provide necessary vaccinations (Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane)</li>
            <li>Access to pre-flight pet transit lounge</li>
            <li>Pre-flight health check by a qualified veterinarian</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <strong class="q">What do I need to do to prepare my pet?</strong>
    <div>
        <p>It is recommended that you:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Include a blanket, toy or something your pet is familiar with in the travel crate with your pet</li>
            <li>Do not feed your pet a full meal eight hours prior to the flight as this may cause an upset stomach (a light treat is okay)</li>
            <li>Take your pet for a walk or let your pet stretch its legs before they go into the travel crate</li>
            <li>Ensure your pet drinks plenty of water and is well hydrated</li>
            <li>Ensure your pet's vaccinations, flea treatments and worming are up to date</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <strong class="q">Are sedatives used?</strong>
    <div>
        <p>No. We do not sedate your pet unless specifically recommended by a vet. Pets sedated and travelling at the flying altitude can be susceptible to dehydration, disorientation and travel sickness.</p>
    </div>

    <strong class="q">Will my pet need any special immunisations? What about quarantine?</strong>
    <div>
        <p>All pets travelling overseas must fulfill the requirements of the receiving country of destination.</p>
        <p>Our pet moving consultant will provide you with all immunisation and quarantine requirements well in advance of your pet's travel.</p>
