    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions:</h2>

    <p><strong>I only want to store a few items.  Can you still help me?</strong></p>
    <p>Yes we can.  We can arrange a suitable option for storing goods of different sizes.  Please <a href="#">contact us</a> to discuss your requirements.</p>

    <p><strong>How often can I access my stored goods?</strong></p>
    <p>This depends on where your goods are stored.  In many storage facilities you can access your goods during standard business hours.</p>

    <p><strong>How do your prices compare to self-storage solutions?</strong></p>
    <p>Storing your goods with our international partners is generally more cost-effective than choosing a 24-hour access self-storage solution.</p>

    <p>TODO.</p>

    <p><strong>Do you have the facilities for storing large/unique items?</strong></p>
