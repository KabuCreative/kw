    <strong class="q">Can you deliver and pick-up on weekends?</strong>
    <div>
        <p>Yes - on request. A minimum four hour weekend surcharge does apply to cover the additional costs of supplying an art handler and specialist truck.</p>
    </div>

    <strong class="q">Do you move art by air or sea?</strong>
    <div>
        <p>We can move art by either service, depending on your budget and requirements.</p>
        <p>Works of art and valuable objects are generally transported by air as it is a faster service which minimises risk and is better suited to smaller shipments.</p>

    </div>

    <strong class="q">Will I have to pay customs, duties and taxes when sending artwork overseas?</strong>
    <div>
        <p>This depends on the country you are shipping to and the purpose for the shipment.</p>
        <p>Most definitive imports are subject to local sales taxes. Most countries have duty exemptions for works of art. There are mechanisms and processes to deal with travelling exhibitions or temporary imports or exports.</p>
        <p>King &amp; Wilson Essential Art Services is able to provide customs advice for all international destinations and can tailor bespoke customs declaration solutions.</p>
        </div>

    <strong class="q">Can you handle large, awkward, heavy objects such as large bronze sculptures and installations consisting of many objects?</strong>
    <div>
        <p>Yes, we have access to cranes, forklifts, slings and hydraulic tail lift equipment to safely transport your large, sensitive, awkward or heavy objects.</p>
    </div>

    <strong class="q">Can you guarantee specific climate conditions during transport?</strong>
    <div>
        <p>By choosing the right packing method, we can insulate artwork from changes in temperature during transit. We have a range of insulating materials for packing and crating and our own fleet of climate controlled vehicles.</p>
