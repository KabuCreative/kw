    <strong class="q">I only want to store a few items. Can you still help me?</strong>
    <div>
        <p>Yes we can. We have a range of options suitable for storing belongings of different sizes. Please <a href="/contact-us/">contact us</a> to discuss your requirements.</p>
    </div>

    <strong class="q">How often can I access my stored belongings?</strong>
    <div>
        <p>This depends on where your belongings are stored. For storage at our Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra warehouses, you can access your belongings during standard business hours, under supervision.</p>
    </div>

    <strong class="q">How do your prices compare to self-storage solutions?</strong>
    <div>
        <p>Storing your belongings in our Australian warehouses is significantly more cost-effective than choosing a 24-hour access self-storage solution.</p>
    </div>

    <strong class="q">Where are your storage facilities located?</strong>
    <div>
        <p>We can arrange for your possessions to be stored in almost any location worldwide. Our primary local facilities are:</p>

        </ul>

    <strong class="q">Are there anything I can't store?</strong>
    <div>
        <p>Flammable or toxic items such as fuel, gases, paints, poisons, aerosol sprays are not permitted, nor are perishable items such as food and plants.</p>
    </div>

    <strong class="q">Do you have the facilities for storing large/unique items?</strong>
    <div>
        <p>Yes. We used a containerised system, so if you can fit it into a shipping container - you can store it with us.</p>
        <p>We also have specialist climate controlled storage facilities for works of art. <a href="/contact-us/">Contact us</a> for more information.</p>
