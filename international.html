    <h1>International Moving Specialists by <a href="/international-air-freight/">Air</a> or by <a href="/international-sea-freight/">Sea</a>.</h1>
    <p>King &amp; Wilson have the processes, expertise and international network to make your overseas move as streamlined as possible.</p>
    <p>Our processes and services are benchmarked against world standards.  Here's how it works:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>We conduct an in-home consultation to guide you through the moving process, recommending a container size or air freight option and determining the best shipping schedule for your needs.  This process usually takes between 30 minutes and one hour.</li>
        <li>On the scheduled day, we visit your home to pack your cartons and wrap your furniture to export standards.</li>
        <li>Your goods are transferred to our warehouse and then onto the appropriate plane or ship.</li>
        <li>We ensure all of the neccessary paperwork is in order to facilitate prompt customs clearance.</li>
        <li>We deliver the goods to your new home - unpacking the cartons, placing furniture and disposing of any mess.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We pride ourselves on providing you with as much assistance as you need to make your move stress free.  Should you require it, we can arrange:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="/storage/">Storage</a> of your goods at either end of your move.</li>
        <li><a href="#">Cleaning</a> of your home.</li>

    <h3>Frequently Asked Questions:</h3>

    <p><strong>I only want to send a few items, can you still help me?</strong></p>
    <p>Yes we can.  Our excess baggage department specialises in packing and shipping small quantities of unaccompanied personal effects by sea or air.</p>
    <p>To get an instant quote, please click <a href="#">here</a>.</p>

    <p><strong>Can I pack my own boxes?</strong></p>
    <p>Yes, you can pack your own boxes. Some clients elect to pack clothes, books and linen and leave the more fragile items to us.  If you choose to do this, we will supply you with appropriate export quality boxes and packing materials.</p>
    <p>We can also provide you with instructions for packing your boxes to export standards, however we can not be responsible for any breakages in boxes packed by you.</p>
    <p>Cartons and belongings which are to be transported overseas by air are required to be packed and sealed by King &amp; Wilson security cleared staff.</p>

    <p><strong>Do I need insurance?</strong></p>
    <p>Whilst it is unusual for items to be damaged or lost in transit, for your peace of mind we recommend that you take out <a href="/insurance/">transit insurance</a>.  To help you get the right cover, we have put together a cost-effective policy specifically designed to protect your goods during transit and/or storage in our warehouses.</p>
    <p><a href="#">Request a quote</a> or <a href="/contact-us/">contact us</a> to speak to a moving consultant about the appropriate insurance for your move.</p>

    <p><strong>How long will it take for my goods to arrive?</strong></p>
    <p>This depends on whether you are sending your items by air or sea as well as the final destination.</p>
    <p>Air transit times can be found <a href="/international-air-freight/#air-freight-times">here</a>, sea transit times can be found <a href="/international-sea-freight/#sea-freight-times">here</a>.</p>

    <p><strong>How much notice do I need to provide?</strong></p>
    <p>The amount of notice required depends on the nature of your move. We recommend that you book your international removal three to four weeks prior to departure. Booking ahead will allow us to secure and confirm your booking for your preferred dates and give you sufficient time to prepare for your move.</p>
    <p>Please note that more notice may be required for moves planned during the peak summer period (December to January).</p>

    <p><strong>Do I need to be there on the moving day?</strong></p>
    <p>No, you do not need to be present for the entire packing and moving process. However, if you are unable to attend in person, it is important that you nominate an authorised representative to allow our crews access to your home and be present to observe and sign your packing inventory.</p>
