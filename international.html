    <strong class="q">I only want to send a few items, can you still help me?</strong>
    <div>
        <p>Yes we can. Our <a href="/excess-baggage/">excess baggage</a> department specialises in packing and shipping small quantities of unaccompanied personal effects by sea or air to many popular cities and countries.</p>

    </div>

    <strong class="q">Can I pack my own boxes?</strong>
    <div>
        <p>Yes, you can pack your own boxes. Some clients elect to pack clothes, books and linen and leave the more fragile items to us. If you choose to do this, we will supply you with appropriate export quality boxes and packing materials.</p>
        <p>We can also provide you with instructions for packing your boxes to export standards, however we can not be responsible for any breakages in boxes packed by you.</p>
        <p>Cartons and belongings which are to be transported overseas by air must be checked, repacked and sealed by King &amp; Wilson security cleared staff.</p>
    </div>

    <strong class="q">Do I need insurance?</strong>
    <div>
        <p>Whilst it is unusual for items to be damaged or lost in transit, for your peace of mind we recommend that you take out <a href="/insurance/">transit insurance</a>. To help you get the right cover, we have put together a cost-effective policy specifically designed to protect your belongings during transit and/or storage.</p>
        <p><a href="#">Request a quote</a> or <a href="/contact-us/">contact us</a> to speak to a moving consultant about the appropriate insurance for your move.</p>
    </div>

    <strong class="q">How long will it take for my belongings to arrive?</strong>
    <div>
        <p>This depends on whether you are sending your items by air or sea as well as the final destination.</p>
        <p>Air transit times can be found <a href="/international-air-freight/#air-freight-times">here</a>, sea transit times can be found <a href="/international-sea-freight/#sea-freight-times">here</a>.</p>
    </div>

    <strong class="q">Do you deliver to a house or apartment?</strong>
    <div>
        <p>Our standard international moving service includes delivery to a residence up to first floor with clear vehicle access from the street. This service is inclusive of checking off the packing list, placing furniture and boxes into nominated rooms, unwrapping and re-assembling furniture items, unpacking boxes onto flat surfaces and removing the packing debris and rubbish.</p>
        <p>Our international baggage services are priced to be a more economical transport solution and therefore delivery is to ground floor only and excludes unpacking.</p>
    </div>

    <strong class="q">Can I track my shipment?</strong>
    <div>
        <p>Yes, we provide our customers with regular email updates and a client login to our website which allows you to monitor the progress of your shipment.</p>
    </div>

    <strong class="q">How much notice do I need to provide?</strong>
    <div>
        <p>The amount of notice required depends on the nature of your move. We recommend that you book your international removal three to four weeks prior to departure. Booking ahead will allow us to secure and confirm your booking for your preferred dates and give you sufficient time to prepare for your move.</p>
        <p>Please note that more notice may be required for moves planned during the peak summer period (December to January).</p>
    </div>

    <strong class="q">Do I need to be there on moving day?</strong>
    <div>
        <p>No, you do not need to be present for the entire packing and moving process. However, if you are unable to attend in person, it is important that you nominate an authorised representative to allow our crews access to your home and be present to observe and sign your packing inventory.</p>
