    <h3>Frequently Asked Questions:</h3>

    <p><strong>Can I pack my own boxes?</strong></p>
    <p>Yes, you can pack your own boxes. Some clients elect to pack clothes, books and linen and leave the more fragile items to us.  If you choose to do this, we will supply you with appropriate export quality boxes and packing materials.</p>
    <p>We can also provide you with instructions for packing your boxes to export standards, however we can not be responsible for any breakages in boxes packed by you.</p>
    <p>Cartons and belongings which are to be transported overseas by air are required to be packed and sealed by King &amp; Wilson security cleared staff.</p>

    <p><strong>Do I need insurance?</strong></p>
    <p>Whilst it is unusual for items to be damaged or lost in transit, for your peace of mind we recommend that you take out <a href="#">transit insurance</a>.  To help you get the right cover, we have put together a cost-effective policy specifically designed to protect your goods during transit and/or storage in our warehouses.</p>
    <p><a href="#">Request a quote</a> or <a href="#">contact us</a> to speak to a moving consultant about the appropriate insurance for your move.</p>

    <p><strong>How long will it take for my goods to arrive?</strong></p>
    <p>This depends on whether you are sending your items by air or sea as well as the final destination.</p>
    <p>Air transit times can be found on the <a href="">air freight</a> page.</p>
    <p>Transit times for sea shipments can be found on the individual destination pages (linked to above).</p>

    <p><strong>How much notice do I need to provide?</strong></p>
    <p>The amount of notice required depends on the nature of your move. We recommend that you book your international removal three to four weeks prior to departure. You should allow one to two weeks notice for an Interstate removal. These suggested lead times will allow us to secure and confirm your booking for your preferred dates and give you sufficient time to prepare for your move. Our Moving Planners contain a useful time-line schedule of helpful tips to guide you through the process and have you ready for moving day.</p>
    <p>Please note that a greater leader time is required for moves planned for the peak Summer period which runs from December to January.</p>

    <p><strong>Do I need to be there on the moving day?</strong></p>
    <p>No, you do not need to be present for the entire packing and moving process. However, if you are unable to attend in person, it is important that you nominate an authorised representative to allow our crews access to you home and be present to observe and sign the compiliation of your packing inventory for all interstate, storage and international moves.</p>
