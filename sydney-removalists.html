    <h3>Frequently Asked Questions:</h3>
    <p><strong>Can I pack my own boxes?</strong></p>
    <p>Yes, you can pack your own boxes. Some clients elect to pack clothes, books and linen and leave the more fragile items to us.  If you choose to do this, we will supply you with appropriate professional quality boxes and packing materials.</p>
    <p>We can also provide you with instructions for packing your boxes to professional standards, however we can not be responsible for any breakages in boxes packed by you.</p>

    <p><strong>How will my possessions be moved?</strong></p>
    <p>Most inter-city removals are effected using specially constructed hi-cube furniture containers which are loaded and sealed at residence. These containers travel between Australian cities on the Pacific National freight rail network. The use of inter-modal containers is a feature of the contemporary Australian moving industry, offering customers the benefits of minimising excessive handling and allowing for short term storage at interstate destinations. </p>
    <p>Local moves are carried out by specialist moving trucks.  Depending on the goods your inventory we may utilise specialist equipment for moving heavier items.</p>

    <p><strong>How much notice do I need to provide?</strong></p>
    <p>The amount of notice required depends on the nature of your move.</p>
    <p>We recommend that you book your interstate move four to six weeks prior to departure. These suggested lead times will allow us to secure and confirm your booking for your preferred dates and give you sufficient time to prepare for your move. </p>
    <p>Of course, interstate moves can be still be arranged successfully at shorter notice, depending on your individual circumstances and booking capacity. </p>
    <p>For local moves, we usually require TODO days notice.</p>

    <p><strong>How long will it take for my things to arrive?</strong></p>
    <p>Most local moves are conducted on the same day, unless you require your goods to be stored between your two homes.</p>
    <p>Interstate transit times vary depending on the distance involved and the quantity of goods being moved.  Transit times for full containers are:
    <ul>
        <li>Sydney to Melbourne - 2 days</li>
        <li>Sydney to Brisbane - 2 days</li>
        <li>Sydney to Perth - 5 days</li>
        <li>Sydney to Darwin - 5 days</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Please <a href="/contact-us/">contact us</a> for transit times to destinations not listed above.</p>

    <p><strong>Can you move art, antiques, pianos or billiard tables?</strong></p>
    <p>Yes, we can!  We have a specialist staff who are trained and accustomed to moving antiques. We also have an <a href="#">art transport division</a> equipped and skilled at moving, storing and installing valuable and fragile works of art. This department uses specialised air ride climate vehicles and our art handlers are trained to museum handling standards.
    <p>Many of our vehicles contain piano trolleys and have hydraulic tail lifters. Our staff are also experienced at disassembling and reassembling grand pianos and multi piece slate billiard tables.</p>

    <p><strong>Do I need insurance?</strong></p>
    <p>Whilst it is unusual for items to be damaged or lost in transit, for your peace of mind we recommend that you take out <a href="/insurance/">transit insurance</a>.  To help you get the right cover, we have put together a cost-effective policy specifically designed to protect your goods during transit and/or storage in our warehouses.</p>
