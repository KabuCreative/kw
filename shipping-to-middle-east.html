    <h3>Frequently Asked Questions:</h3>

    <p><strong>I only want to ship a few items.  Can you still help me?</strong></p>
    <p>Yes we can.  Our excess baggage department specialises in packing and shipping small quantities of unaccompanied personal effects.</p>
    <p>To get an instant quote, please click <a href="#">here</a>.</p>

    <p><strong>Can I pack my boxes myself?</strong></p>
    <p>Yes, you can pack your own boxes. Some clients elect to pack clothes, books and linen and leave the more fragile items to us.  If you choose to do this, we will supply you with appropriate export quality boxes and packing materials.</p>
    <p>We can also provide you with instructions for packing your boxes to export standards, however we can not be responsible for any breakages in boxes packed by you.</p>

    <p><strong>How long will it take for my goods to arrive?</strong></p>
    <p>Shipping from Australia to the Middle East takes TODO weeks depending on the end destination and time of year.</p>
    <p>In the unlikely event your shipment is delayed beyond this timeframe, we will refund your freight charges in full.</p>
    <p>If you require some of your items to arrive within a shorter timeframe, we recommend utilising our <a href="/international-air-freight/">air freight</a> service.  Many of our clients find this to be a more cost effective solution than paying airline excess baggage.</p>

    <p><strong>Is there anything that I can't ship?</strong></p>
    <p>For safety and security there are some items that cannot be shipped.  Most of these items fall under the classification of Prohibited Goods such as LPG gas bottles, paints, aerosols and solvents.</p>
    <p>You can download a full list of prohibited items <a href="">here</a>.</p>

    <p><strong>Do I need insurance?</strong></p>
