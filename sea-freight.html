        <p>We can also provide you with instructions for packing your boxes to export standards, however we can not be responsible for any breakages in boxes packed by you.</p>

        <p>If you require some of your items to arrive within a shorter timeframe, we recommend utilising our <a href="/international-air-freight/">air freight</a> service. Many of our clients find this to be a more cost-effective solution than paying airline excess baggage.</p>
    </div>

    <strong class="q">What about unusual items?  Can I ship art, antiques, pianos or billiard tables?</strong>
    <div>
        <p>Yes, you can!  We have specialist staff who are trained and accustomed to moving antiques. We also have an <a href="/art/">art transport division</a> equipped and skilled at moving, storing and installing valuable and fragile works of art. This department uses specialised air ride climate vehicles and our art handlers are trained to museum handling standards.
        <p>Many of our vehicles contain piano trolleys and have hydraulic tail lifters. Our staff are also experienced at disassembling and reassembling grand pianos and multi piece slate billiard tables.</p>
    </div>

    <strong class="q">Is there anything that I can't ship?</strong>
    <div>
        <p>For safety and security there are some items that cannot be shipped. Most of these items fall under the classification of prohibited belongings such as LPG gas bottles, paints, aerosols and solvents.</p>
        <p><a href="#">Download a full list of prohibited items here</a>.</p>
    </div>

    <strong class="q">Do I need insurance?</strong>
    <div>
        <p>Whilst it is unusual for items to be damaged or lost in transit, for your peace of mind we recommend that you take out <a href="/insurance/">transit insurance</a>. To help you get the right cover, we have put together a cost-effective policy specifically designed to protect your belongings during transit and/or storage.</p>
        <p><a href="#" class="get-quote">Request a quote</a> or <a href="/contact-us/">contact us</a> to speak to a moving consultant about the appropriate insurance for your move.</p>
    </div>

    <strong class="q">Do I need to be there on moving day?</strong>
    <div>
        <p>No, you do not need to be present for the entire packing and moving process. However, if you are unable to attend in person, it is important that you nominate an authorised representative to allow our crews access to your home and be present to observe and sign your packing inventory.</p>
    </div>

    <strong class="q">Can I track my shipment?</strong>
    <div>
        <p>Yes, we provide our customers with regular email updates and a client login to our website which allows you to monitor the progress of your shipment.</p>

        <h2>Faster transit times</h2>
        <p>To save costs, many shipping companies will hold your belongings at their warehouse until they are able to fill an entire shipping container bound for your destination. This means that you may wait weeks, or even months, for your belongings to depart Australia.</p>
        <p>At King &amp; Wilson we understand that you want to receive your possessions as soon as possible and are committed to the high-frequency departure of all our containers - whether they are full or not. </p>
        <p>For your peace of mind, we offer an <a href="/on-time/">on-time guarantee</a> - <strong>if your belongings do not arrive into their destination port on time, we'll refund your shipping costs.</strong>
