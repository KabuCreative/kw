    <h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>

    <p><strong>I only want to ship a few items. Can you still help me?</strong></p>
    <p>Yes we can. Our <a href="/excess-baggage/">excess baggage</a> department specialises in packing and shipping small quantities of unaccompanied personal effects.</p>
    <p>To get an instant baggage quote, please click <a href="#">here</a>.</p>

    <p><strong>Can I pack my boxes myself?</strong></p>
    <p>Yes, you can pack your own boxes. Some clients elect to pack clothes, books and linen and leave the more fragile items to us. If you choose to do this, we will supply you with appropriate export quality boxes and packing materials.</p>
    <p>We can also provide you with instructions for packing your boxes to export standards, however we can not be responsible for any breakages in boxes packed by you.</p>

    <p><strong>How long will it take for my belongings to arrive?</strong></p>
    <p>Shipping from Australia to the North Island takes between 3 and 6 weeks, with the South Island taking between 6 and 9 weeks.</p>
    <p>In the unlikely event your shipment is delayed beyond this timeframe, we will refund your freight charges in full.</p>
    <p>If you require some of your items to arrive within a shorter timeframe, we recommend utilising our <a href="/international-air-freight/">air freight</a> service. Many of our clients find this to be a more cost-effective solution than paying airline excess baggage.</p>

    <p><strong>Do you deliver to a house or apartment?</strong></p>
    <p>Our standard international moving service includes delivery to a residence up to first floor with clear vehicle access from the street. This service is inclusive of checking off the packing list, placing furniture and boxes into nominated rooms, unwrapping and re-assembling furniture items, unpacking boxes onto flat surfaces and removing the packing debris and rubbish.</p>
    <p>Our international baggage services are priced to be a more economical transport solution and therefore delivery is to ground floor only and excludes unpacking.</p>

    <p><strong>Can I track my shipment?</strong></p>
    <p>Yes, we provide our customers with regular email updates and a client login to our website which allows you to monitor the progress of your shipment.</p>

    <p><strong>Is there anything that I can't ship?</strong></p>
    <p>For safety and security there are some items that cannot be shipped. Most of these items fall under the classification of prohibited belongings such as LPG gas bottles, paints, aerosols and solvents.</p>
    <p><a href="#">Download a full list of prohibited items here</a>.</p>

    <p><strong>Do I need insurance?</strong></p>
    <p>Whilst it is unusual for items to be damaged or lost in transit, for your peace of mind we recommend that you take out <a href="/insurance/">transit insurance</a>. To help you get the right cover, we have put together a cost-effective policy specifically designed to protect your belongings during transit and/or storage.</p>
    <p><a href="#">Request a quote</a> or <a href="/contact-us/">contact us</a> to speak to a moving consultant about the appropriate insurance for your move.</p>

    <p><strong>Will I have to pay at New Zealand customs?</strong></p>
    <p>There is no customs duty payable when shipping goods between Australia and New Zealand.  You will, however, be required to pay 15% GST on any alcohol, tobacco or items you have not owned for more than 12 months. Used personal effects which you have owned for over 12 months are GST free.</p>
    <p>For more information on New Zealand's customs regulations, please download our <a href="#">guide</a>.</p>

    <p><strong>What about New Zealand quarantine?</strong></p>
    <p>New Zealand maintains a strict quarantine process to prevent the entry of disease or pests into the country. This means that all personal effects shipments are subject to mandatory inspection and clearance by New Zealand Ministry of Agriculture officers. This inspection occurs under supervision at one of our New Zealand partner quarantine accredited warehouses. There is a fee payable locally for this service; you will be advised of this amount in our quotation.</p>
    <p>Items of particular interest to quarantine officers are tools, sporting equipment (including footwear and golf clubs), lawn mowers, bicycles and outdoor furniture.</p>
