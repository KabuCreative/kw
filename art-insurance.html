    <h2>Cost-effective art transport insurance</h2>
    <p>Whilst it is unusual for items to be lost or damanged in transit, for your peace of mind we recommend you take out transit insurance for the period your objects are being moved and stored.</p>
    <p>To that end, we have developed an insurance policy specifically designed to protect your fine arts and antiques during transit and/or storage in our warehouses. We provide an Indemnity Cover policy for works of art and antiques.</p>
    <p>For more insurance information speak to your moving consultant, or download our <a href="">documentation booklet</a> which contains our financial services guide, product disclosure statement, and insurance policy wording.</p>
