                <h2>Cost-effective art transport insurance</h2>
                <p>Whilst it is unusual for items to be lost or damanged in transit, for your peace of mind we recommend you take out transit insurance for the period your objects are being moved and stored.</p>
                <p>To that end, we have worked with several international underwriters and insurance brokers to develop a range of policies specifically designed to protect fine arts and antiques during transit and/or storage anywhere in the world.</p>
                <p>King &amp; Wilson is an ASIC accredited respresentative of Cowden, Aldridge &amp; Street insurance brokers, which holds Australian Financial Services LIcence No 245658.</p>
                <p>For more insurance information speak to your King &amp; Wilson consultant, or download our <a href="#">documentation booklet</a> which contains our financial services guide, product disclosure statement, and insurance policy wording.</p>
