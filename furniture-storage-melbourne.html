    <strong class="q">I only want to store a few items. Can you still help me?</strong>
    <div>
        <p>Yes we can. We have a range of options suitable for storing belongings of different sizes. Please <a href="/contact-us/">contact us</a> to discuss your requirements.</p>
    </div>

    <strong class="q">How often can I access my stored belongings?</strong>
    <div>
        <p>You can access your belongings during standard business hours, under supervision. If you need to access some possessions more often than others, we can arrange to pack the storage container to reflect this.</p>
    </div>

    <strong class="q">How do your prices compare to self-storage solutions?</strong>
    <div>
        <p>Storing your belongings in our Melbourne warehouse is significantly more cost-effective than choosing a 24-hour access self-storage solution.</p>

    <div>
        <p>Flammable or toxic items such as fuel, gases, paints, poisons, aerosol sprays are not permitted, nor are perishable items such as food and plants.</p>
    </div>

    <strong class="q">Do you have the facilities for storing large/unique items?</strong>
    <div>
        <p>Yes. We used a containerised system, so if you can fit it into a shipping container - you can store it with us.</p>
        <p>We also have specialist climate controlled storage facilities for works of art. <a href="/contact-us/">Contact us</a> for more information.</p>
