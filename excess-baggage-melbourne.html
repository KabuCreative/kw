    <a class="q">How much does it cost?</a>
    <div>
        <p>This depends on the amount you wish to ship and the final destination.  Please <a href="/contact-us/">contact us</a> or <a href="#" class="get-quote">request an instant quote</a> for more information.</p>
    </div>

    <a class="q">Is there anything I can't send?</a>
    <div>
        <p>Yes, there are a number of belongings that are prohibited, including LPG gas bottles, paints, aerosols and solvents.</p>
        <p>A full list of prohibited items will be provided to you by your moving consultant.</p>
    </div>

    <a class="q">How is the cost calculated?</a>
    <div>
        <p>For shipments sent by sea the cost is calculated by volume (in square meters).</p>
        <p>Air freight is calculated by 'chargeable weight' - the actual gross weight or the volumetric weight of the shipment â€“ whichever is the greater.</p>
        <p>To make matters more complicated, the formula for chargeable weight changes depending on the airline or air courier we partner with to ship your belongings.</p>
        <p>In all cases, we move your belongings in the most cost-effective manner so to pass on the best possible price to you. <a href="/contact-us/">Contact us</a> to receive an accurate, no obligation quote.</p>

    <a class="q">Do I need insurance?</a>
    <div>
        <p>Whilst it is unusual for items to be damaged or lost in transit, for your peace of mind we recommend that you take out <a href="/insurance/">transit insurance</a>. To help you get the right cover, we have put together a cost-effective policy specifically designed to protect your belongings during transit and/or storage.</p>

        <h3>Cost-effective</h3>
        <p>Our excess baggage service is significantly more cost-effective than paying for airline excess baggage or arranging for your belongings to be moved by international courier.</p>

        <h3 class="margin-top">Faster transit times</h3>
        <p>To save costs, many shipping companies will hold your belongings at their warehouse until they are able to fill an entire shipping container bound for your destination. This means that you may wait weeks, or even months, for your belongings to depart Australia.</p>
        <p>We are committed to shipping your belongings quickly and effeciently, and offer a <a href="/on-time/">transit time guarantee</a> for most international locations.</p>
